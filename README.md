<h1>OpenGL Programs in C++</h1> 

This repository contains a collection of OpenGL programs written in C++. These programs demonstrate various graphics rendering techniques, such as basic shapes, transformations, lighting effects, and texture mapping.

## Usage
To run these programs, ensure you have OpenGL installed on your system. You can compile and execute the programs using your preferred C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang.
## Programs

1. `basic_shapes.cpp`: Demonstrates rendering basic shapes such as points, lines, and triangles.
2. `transformations.cpp`: Illustrates various transformations including translation, rotation, and scaling.
3. `lighting_effects.cpp`: Shows different lighting effects such as ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
4. `texture_mapping.cpp`: Demonstrates texture mapping onto geometric primitives.

Feel free to explore each program and experiment with the code to understand OpenGL concepts better.
